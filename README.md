[00:19.84] At first I was afraid
[00:23.02] I was petrified
[00:25.53] I kept thinking I could never live without you
[00:28.28] By my side
[00:33.28] 
[00:30.27] But then I spent so many nights
[00:32.55] Just thinking how you've done me wrong
[00:35.26] I grew strong
[00:37.86] I learned how to get along
[00:50.86] 
[00:40.84] And so you're back
[00:43.31] From outer space
[00:45.36] I just walked in to find you
[00:47.82] Here with that look upon your face
[01:04.82] 
[00:50.88] I should have changed my fucking lock
[00:53.34] I would have made you leave your key
[00:55.89] If I had known for just one second
[00:58.62] You'd be back to bother me
[01:11.62] 
[01:01.65] Oh now go
[01:03.83] Walk out the door
[01:06.32] Just turn around
[01:08.36] Now, you're not welcome anymore
[01:23.86] 
[01:11.17] Weren't you the one
[01:13.66] Who tried to break me with desire?
[01:16.12] Did you think I'd crumble?
[01:18.37] Did you think I'd lay down and die?
[01:35.87] 
[01:21.13] Oh not I, I will survive
[01:25.69] Yeah
[01:26.63] As Long as I know how to love
[01:28.93] I know I'll be alive
[01:38.93] 
[01:31.27] I've got all my life to live
[01:33.69] I've got all my love to give
[01:36.40] I will survive, I will survive
[01:40.91] Yeah, yeah
[01:45.91] 
[02:20.73] It took all the strength I had
[02:23.43] Just not to fall apart
[02:25.40] I'm trying hard to mend the pieces
[02:28.50] Of my broken heart
[02:37.50] 
[02:30.77] And I spent oh so many nights
[02:33.57] Just feeling sorry for myself
[02:36.35] I used to cry
[02:39.01] But now I hold my head up high
[02:54.01] 
[02:41.58] And you see me
[02:43.81] With somebody new
[02:46.32] I'm not that stupid little person
[02:48.84] Still in love with you
[02:59.84] 
[02:50.84] And so you thought you'd just drop by
[02:54.12] And you expect me to be free
[02:56.15] But now I'm saving all my lovin'
[02:58.89] For someone who's lovin' me
[03:12.39] 
[03:01.84] Oh now go
[03:04.17] Walk out the door
[03:06.36] Just turn around
[03:08.59] Now, you're not welcome anymore
[03:24.09] 
[03:12.12] Weren't you the one
[03:14.47] Who tried to break me with desire?
[03:16.57] Did you think I'd crumble?
[03:18.85] Did you think I'd lay down and die?
[03:36.35] 
[03:21.56] Oh not I will survive
[03:26.11] Yeah
[03:26.87] As long as I know how to love
[03:28.83] I know I'll be alive
[03:38.83] 
[03:31.41] I've got all my life to live
[03:33.67] I've got all my love to give
[03:36.16] I will survive, I will survive
[03:40.93] Yeah, yeah
[03:45.93] 
[03:45.91] Oh no
