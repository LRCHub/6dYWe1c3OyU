The night will see the future
Don't you know by now
The long and lonely night
I finally see the light
Like a demons dream, lights burning

Love's not black and white
And I'm still alive, and I will survive
Yeah, come on baby
I will survive
Come on honey

I could see the future, it's just one dark cloud
Let's leave it to the second dance
You won't keep me waitin' too long
I can see the street light burning

Love's not black and white
And I'm still alive, and I will survive
Well come on baby
I will survive
Yeah come on baby

The winds are hints of trouble as the skies
They turn to red
Knock knock knock, heaven upside down
As this devil takes his hand

Well I will survive
Come on baby
Well I will survive
Come on honey
Well I will survive
Well I will survive
Love's not black and, love's not black and
Love's not black and white
I will survive
