The battle line is drawn
I dare you to cross it
You better think twice
Before you mix it up with me

I won't back down
I'll keep the fire burning
As hard as you try
You're never gonna stop me now, no

You think you're shaking my innocence
But you're wasting time
Cause you don't know who I am.

I will survive
I'm driven by the faith
You can see it in my eyes
It's written on my face
I will survive
And I won't let it
Fall from grace

All around the world
There are true believers
I know I'm not alone
There's someone watching over me

Ow! Stand my ground
While the world keeps turning
If I believe enough
I'm never gonna fade away, hey

You think you're shaking my innocence
But you're wasting time
Cause you don't know who I am.

I will survive
I'm driven by the faith
You can see it in my eyes
It's written on my face
I will survive
No I won't let it
I won't let it fall from grace

(Fall from grace...)
There's someone watching over me.
(Fall from grace...)
Nothing's gonna stop me now
Gonna stand my ground

I will survive
You can see it in my eyes...

I will survive
I've driven by the faith
You can see it in my eyes
It's written on my face
I will survive
I will survive
I won't let it fall from grace

I will survive
You can see it in my eyes
I will survive
Yeah...
I will survive
I will survive
