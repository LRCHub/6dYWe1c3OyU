I must admit I was afraid and just a little scared,
You were something that I had longed for,
Let me get a little closer I'll go anywhere,
Across the ocean I'll be there,
My emotions they will never changed,
I'm down on my knees for you,
And you can tell me I'm wrong,
But baby you feel it too,
It's all right,
And I know that you'll change your mind,

Chorus
I will survive,
If I exist in your eyes,
Feels so alive,
I can't describe,
What I'm feeling inside,
You are my one, my love, my life,

Seems like forever baby I've been watching from afar,
But now it's over I need to hold you,
Even if it's only just for a little while,
For me an eternity,
Remember baby when you told me that you loved me too,
And that you'd always be there for me,
It's alright,
And I know that you'll change you mind,

Chorus
I will survive,
If I exist in your eyes,
Feels so alive,
I can't describe,
What I'm feeling inside,
You are my one, my love, my life,

And I can see it baby in your eyes,
You know that we were meant to be,
You'd never find it even if you tried,
A love like mine,

Chorus
I will survive,
If I exist in your eyes,
Feels so alive,
I can't describe,
What I'm feeling inside,
You are my one, my love, my life
