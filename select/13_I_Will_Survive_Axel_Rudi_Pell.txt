Day after day and night after night
Watching the tide rolling in
Your feeling o.k., you're feeling alright
That's when the pain rushes in, that's right
The wink of an eye, a turn of the screw
Watching the signs passing by
I was so blind, I never knew
She was changing in front of my eyes
I look away, I feel my heart beat faster
It's in her eyes, she's already gone
There's no turning back
I will survive,
I've been down on my knees too long
I will survive,
I'll get back on my feet again
I will survive,
I've been holding on too long
I will survive, I will rise up,
'Cause tomorrow is already gone
Like a thief in the night,
She's slipping away
Trying to hide from the truth
She'll never say why,
She never knew when
But she's got my heart in a noose
Hide away,
She don't wanna hear that I love her
Walk away, she's already gone,
She may never come back
I will survive,
I've been down on my knees too long
I will survive,
I'll get back on my feet again
I will survive,
I've been holding on too long
I will survive, I will rise up,
'Cause tomorrow is already gone
[Solo]
Look away, I feel my heart beat faster
It's in her eyes, her loving is gone
There's no turning back
I will survive,
I've been down on my knees too long
I will survive,
I'll get back on my feet again
I will survive,
I've been holding on too long
I will survive, I will rise up, I will rise up
I will survive, hm yeah, I will survive
I will survive,
I've been down on my knees,
I've been down in the dirt babe too long
I will survive, I've been holding on,
I've been holding on too long
I will survive,
I gotta, I gotta, I gotta let it go
I will survive
