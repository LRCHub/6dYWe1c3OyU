Draw a line in the sand
I dare you to cross it
You'd better think twice
For you to mix it up with me
No I won't turn down
I'll keep the fire burning
Hard as you try, you're never gonna stop the sound
You think you're shakin' my innocence
But you're wastin' my time
Cause you don't know who I am
I will survive
Defender of the faith
The power is alive
Defiant in your face
I will survive
I won't let it fall from grace
All around the world
There are true believers
No I'm not alone
You're never gonna move the stone
Rock & roll it's here to stay
It will never burn out
It's never gonna fade away
You think you're shakin' my innocence
But you're wasting time
Cause you don't know who I am
I will survive
Defender of the faith
The power is alive
Defiant in your face
I will survive
I won't let it fall from grace
